## Installation
Run `npm i` to install the following dependencies:
* mysql
* express
* express-handlebars
* nodemon

For the burger database, look in the db directory for `db/schema.sql` and `db/seeds.sql`. Use these to create a `burgers_db` database populated with three burgers.

## Usage
Launch the app with either `node server.js` or `npm run devstart`. `devstart` will launch the app with nodemon, which restarts the server after changes to a file are saved.
